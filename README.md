# Git + GitHub Hands‑On (Org Edition)

Minimal Python, maximum Git. Fork this repo from the **organization** to your own account,
clone locally, and complete the labs in `/labs`.

## What you'll practice
- clone · add · commit · push · pull
- branch · merge · open PRs
- handle merge conflicts
- **rebase** (on your fork only) and **reset** (safely)
- use an org as the collaboration hub

## Quick start
```bash
# 1) Fork this repo to your GitHub account (from the org source)
# 2) Clone your fork:
git clone https://github.com/<you>/git_org_hands_on.git
cd git_org_hands_on

# 3) Optional: set upstream to the org source
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<org>/git_org_hands_on.git
git remote -v
```

Open `/labs/00-setup.md` and begin.

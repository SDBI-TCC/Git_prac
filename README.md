# Git + GitHub Hands‑On (Org Edition)

Minimal Python, maximum Git. Fork this repo from the **organization** to your own account,
clone locally, and complete the labs in `/labs`.

## What you'll practice
- clone · add · commit · push · pull
- branch · merge · open PRs
- handle merge conflicts
- **rebase** (on your fork only) and **reset** (safely)
- use an org as the collaboration hub

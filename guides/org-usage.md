# Using the Organization

- The **org repo** is the source of truth. Everyone **forks** it.
- You push to **your fork**, then open **PRs** back to the org repo.
- We protect `main` in the org: PR review required before merge.
- Teams can be created per table (Team‑A, Team‑B) for reviews.
- Never force‑push to the org `main`. Do rebase work **only on your fork**.
